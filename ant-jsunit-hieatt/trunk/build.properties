# This file is a convenient way to define some parameters
# specific to the project, rather than from inside the build script.
#
# Depending on the ant targets that will be invoked,
# some properties will be required, some others won't.
#
# Usually you should not need to override those properties.
# If you really need to, you can create a new file called "local.properties"
# in the same directory and put inside any property you want to fit your local configuration.
#
# If you don't wish to create such a file, you can pass the required properties
# to ant as command line arguments using the -D option.
#
# Do NOT commit the "local.properties" file to the version control system
# (CVS, SVN, ...) : it should stay as a local configuration only.
# Do not modify or remove this file from the v.c.s. either ;-o
