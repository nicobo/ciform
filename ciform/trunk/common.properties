# This file is a convenient way to define some global parameters,
# commons to all projects.
#
# Depending on the projects that will be built,
# some properties will be required, some others may not.
#
# Some important properties are marked "required" so you can spot
# the ones to define locally if you want to build the projects.
#
# If you wish to override some properties, do NOT edit this file :
# create a new file called "local.properties" in the same directory and put
# inside any property you want to fit your local configuration.
#
# Do NOT commit the "local.properties" file to the version control system
# (CVS, SVN, ...) : it should stay as a local configuration only.
# Do not commit or remove this file from the v.c.s. either ;-o
#
# If you don't wish to create such a file, you can pass the required properties
# to ant as command line arguments using the -D option.
