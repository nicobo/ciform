#
# This file defines some static parameters, common to all projects.
#
# Some important properties are marked as "required" so you can spot them.
# They are required to have valid values for the projects to build.
#
# To override some properties, you should not edit this file :
# create a new file called "local.properties" in the same directory and put
# inside any property you want to fit your local configuration.
#
# The "local.properties" file is meant to stay local,
# you'll not find it on the version control system (SVN, Hg, ...).
#
# If you don't wish to create such a file, you may pass the required properties
# to ant as command line arguments using the -D option.

# You can use absolute paths in the properties of this file to get rid of this one.
